Task0:
O(1): Look for first and last record in the list takes constant time

Task1:
O(n): Count all of the numbers once

Task2:
O(n): Count all of the numbers once
Check all numbers in the dictionary once O(n)
Overall O(n)

Task3:
Count all of the numbers once O(n)
Sort the end results O(nlogn)
Overall O(nlogn)

Task4:
Count all of the calls once O(n)
Count all of the texts once O(n)
Check each outgoing number against the sets O(n), but we use contains on each set which is O(logn), so it's O(nlogn)
Sort the end results O(nlogn)
Overall O(nlogn)
